To run instascrape tests, 

First install by running `pip install insta-scrape`

Make sure to include the heady.py file in the same directory as the instagram directory.
You can find heady.py within our discord in the resources text channel. Please make sure to add your session id where it says `YOUR_SESSION_ID`.
Your own seesion id can be found by visting instagram and opening inspector. It should be listed somewhere under cookies. 

Once you've added your own session id you are able to run both tests by calling them with python.
